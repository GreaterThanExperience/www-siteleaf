Research Text: "## Research\n\nTo help the organisations we work with become inherently
  trustworthy, we've got to learn about the people they serve as customers. \n\nTo
  do this we balance qualitative and quantitative research. We work across attitudinal
  and behavioural dimensions to discover what people say, and what they do. \n"
Design Text: "## Design\n\nWe solve human problems that create business value through
  inherently trustworthy models. We 'design', or don't design with data transparently.
  We respect people's right to privacy. We support strong security practices by default.\n\nIn
  short, we help design positive-sum cultures, workflows and experiences that competitively
  differentiate propositions.  "
Strategy Text: "## Strategy\n\nDesigning for trust requires new thinking.\n\nWe help
  bring customer and business metrics into alignment. We dive deep into human motivation.
  We dive deeper into how you should be using data.\n\nWe help make your inherent
  trustworthiness a competitive advantage.  "
First Slide Text: 'Although we''re doing new and unique things, our process has been
  tried and tested. Here we work closely with you to build a shared understanding
  of strategy, objectives, limitations and existing research. This is the foundation
  for all of the work we do.

'
Second Slide Text: "We then engage customers to begin learning about value, meaning
  and engagement (the stuff they actually care about, which of course is the stuff
  you should care about too). This gives us a clear baseline, enabling us to determine
  where you might fit into their lives. \n"
Third Slide Text: From that baseline we start designing or refining inherently trustworthy
  (transparent, value generating and accepting of consequence) experiences. We validate
  their value, meaning and engagement and begin optimising the data (value) flows
  that will enable you to deliver new and unique value to the people you serve.
Fourth Slide Text: At this point we might be a few weeks or a few months into this
  effort. The timeline really doesn't matter. What matters is that we've proven an
  experience that delivers value, meaning and engagement through an inherently trustworthy
  model. It's now time to implement, scale and optimise. We're here to support you
  during that process.
Colophon: This is what we do. But it goes deeper.
