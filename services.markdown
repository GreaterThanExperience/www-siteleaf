Research Text: "## Research\n\nWe balance qualitative and quantitative research. We
  work across attitudinal and behavioural dimensions to discover what people say,
  and what they do. \n\nThese efforts provide clarity. They help us define the metrics
  that matter most. They help us design for trust.\n"
Design Text: "## Design\n\nStarting with paper and pencil, we design value propositions.
  We test them. We validate them. \n\nWe then increase fidelity. We design prototypes
  and conversion funnels. We test them. We validate them.\n\nWe optimise design output
  for trust. From this foundation we deliver value, meaning and engagement to your
  customers."
Strategy Text: "## Strategy\n\nDesigning for trust requires new thinking.\n\nWe help
  bring customer and business metrics into alignment. We help teams navigate change.
  We communicate effectively. We make it easy to understand the why.\n\nWhen trust
  becomes part of your strategy, it becomes your competitive advantage.  "
First Slide Text: 'It''s not news that why we do what we do is as important as the
  outcome itself. When it comes to our methodology, this holds true. Here we work
  closely with the business to build a shared understanding of strategy, objectives,
  limitations and existing research. This is the foundation for all of the work we
  do.

'
Second Slide Text: 'This is where the magic really starts to unfold. Here we engage
  customers to begin learning about value, meaning and engagement through their eyes.
  From this, we define key metrics and get to the bottom of why your product or service
  should exist. It becomes crystal clear why you deserve to be trusted. We then drive
  forward!

'
Third Slide Text: Keeping the customer close, our experience design process begins
  to unfold - quickly. Through short iteration cycles, we define, design and test
  valuable, meaningful and engaging human experiences. We validate your brandsâ€™ trustworthiness.
  Only once we've nailed it do we proceed.
Fourth Slide Text: It's time to start realising business value. At this point we might
  be a few weeks, or a few months into the process. This really doesn't matter. What
  matters is that we've proven an experience that delivers value, meaning and engagement.
  Your product, service or offer now has a distinct place in the lives of your customers.
  It's time to implement, scale and optimise ruthlessly.
Colophon: This is what we do. But it goes deeper.
