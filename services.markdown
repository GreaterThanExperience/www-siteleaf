  ## Research

  Research is the systematic study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions. Well, that’s the official definition.

  For us, research is how we learn quickly and in context. This helps focus our collective time, effort and capital in the right direction.

  ## Design

  Experience Design is about people. It’s about understanding people and helping them get stuff done.

  Our Experience Design process enables us to quantify what people perceive to be valuable, meaningful and engaging.

  We then deliver these outcomes.
Strategy Text: |-
  ## Strategy

  Strategy guides budgets, resource allocation, the product that’s developed, and the way it’s marketed.

  Working strategically helps us design what people care about. It helps us deliver what they’ll pay for.

  When this happens, brands differentiate. They’re better positioned to meet strategic objectives.[[[](https://www.greaterthanexperience.design/services)](https://www.greaterthanexperience.design/services/strategy)](https://www.greaterthanexperience.design/services/strategy)
First Slide Text: 'It''s not news that why we do what we do is as important as the
  outcome itself. When it comes to our methodology, this holds true. Here we work
  closely with the business to build a shared understanding of strategy, objectives,
  limitations and existing research. This is the foundation for all of the work we
  do.

'
Second Slide Text: 'This is where the magic really starts to unfold. Here we engage
  customers to begin learning about value, meaning and engagement through their eyes.
  From this, we define key VME Experience Metrics, and get to the bottom of why your
  product, service or offer should exist. We then drive forward!

'
Third Slide Text: Keeping the customer close, our experience design process begins
  to unfold - quickly. Through short iteration cycles, we define, design and test
  valuable, meaningful and engaging human experiences. Only once we've nailed it do
  we proceed.
Fourth Slide Text: It's time to start realising business value. At this point we might
  be a few weeks, or a few months into the process. This really doesn't matter. What
  matters is that we've proven an experience that delivers value, meaning and engagement.
  Your product, service or offer now has a distinct place in the lives of your customers.
  It's time to implement, scale and optimise ruthlessly.
