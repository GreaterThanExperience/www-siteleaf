Hero Title: There is more to us than meets the eye
Intro First Text: |-
  ### Yes you guessed it!
  ### X stands for ‘greater than experience’ (our domain may have also given that away).
Intro Second Text: |-
  We believe experiences should be greater than the sum of their parts.

  Our experiences should deliver us value, meaning and engagement.
Pillars Lead: This is what we’ve come to define as the 3 pillars of great human experience,
  or VME Design.
Pillars Value First Text: |-
  People choose to hire or fire products and services based on what they’re actually trying to achieve. This is the outcome they really care about; their Job to be Done.

  For an experience to create value and satisfy expectation, it must enable people to achieve their objective.

  Think of value as the core pillar of great experience.
Pillars Value Second Text: |-
  Value is largely subjective. It consists of cultural, personal, consumption and product dimensions. Each of these dimensions impacts decision-making.

  When human experiences are valuable, satisfaction increases. Our limbic brain also produces neurotransmitters. One of them is serotonin, responsible for controlling our greater mood.
Pillars Meaning First Text: |-
  Beyond value, experiences should just ‘fit’. They should have significance in our lives.

  These types of experiences create a lasting impact. We retain detail about them. We have the ability to re-call the details. And we often tell our friends, family, colleagues (and the world) about our experience.

  These are the rare occasions that deliver meaning.
Pillars Meaning Second Text: |-
  People are social creatures. They value relationships and deeply value trust. Oxytocin is the neurotransmitter the brain’s limbic system produces during different forms of social bonding. It’s associated with trust and helps support positive memories.

  When human experiences are meaningful, oxytocin is often present.
Pillars Engagement First Text: |-
  When was the last time you were excited about the product or service you were choosing to hire?

  Was it the gym? How about the movies? Maybe it was YouTube, or perhaps it was a simple bout of mindfulness meditation.

  These experiences are fun. They’re the types of experiences we anticipate. And as a result, we’re intrinsically motivated to complete them.
Pillars Engagement Second Text: |-
  A particular favourite of many, dopamine, is considered the striving emotion. It delivers a sensation of pleasure. It also increases our concentration.

  In reality, it can be highly addictive.

  Thanks to our anticipation, dopamine directly impacts engagement. It’s also a key part of motivating us to hire or fire a product in the first place.
Circle Title: Over time, we’ve come to learn the best experiences are balanced. They
  satisfy, delight, and in the best of cases, engage all 5 human senses.
Process Text: "Drawing on research and design best practice, we’ve developed a [methodology
  for 3 pillar design](/services/#5). A framework that helps uncover value, meaning
  and engagement.\n\nThrough this methodology, we deliver experiences greater than
  the sum of their parts. These experiences are inherently trustworthy. They capture
  hearts, minds and wallets. "
Half Globe Lead: Defining value, meaning and engagement is just the start. Change
  is constant. People and their perceptions evolve.
Half Globe Text: |-
  We recognise this reality and embed it into our process.

  Once an experience makes its way into the real world, we begin optimising ruthlessly.
Promise First Text: Which brings us to our promise – the true purpose of this manifesto.
Promise Quote: For every human problem we encounter, we will relentlessly pursue to
  design for value, for meaning and for engagement.
Promise Second Text: We will create new and unique value for your customers. We will
  help competitively differentiate your offerings. And we will effectively position
  your brand to meet its strategic objectives.
